I’ve made this repository chiefly as a personal back-up but if the contents can be used by or give inspiration to anybody else all well and good.

As it is meant to make FireFox suit my tastes and use-patterns it will almost certainly need amending to suit anybody else’s. 

I use the [Activist — Balanced](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/activist-balanced_/) theme so Icons may not show very well against others.  Colours can be changed by opening the relevant .svg file in a text editor and changing the fill, ie if something is white and you want it black change `fill:#ffffff` to `fill:#000000`.

As well as the usual `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` needing to be set to **`true`** in `about:config` or `user.js` `svg.context-properties.content.enabled` needs to be **`true`** as well.
