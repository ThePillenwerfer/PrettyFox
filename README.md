I’ve made this repository chiefly as a personal back-up but if the contents can be used by or give inspiration to anybody else all well and good.

As it is meant to make FireFox suit **my** tastes and use-patterns it will almost certainly need amending to suit anybody else’s so shouldn't be regarded as ready-to-use. 

Its main purpose is to use better icons than the default ones.  As well as not being very pleasing by default they display needlessly small and widely spaced; recent releases have made the window control icons tiny.  This version uses nicer ones displayed larger and closer together meaning they take up no extra space overall.

A secondary function is to remove things I'll never click which makes the things I do use easier to find.  Besides that there are various miscellaneous tweaks.

I use the [Activist — Balanced](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/activist-balanced_/) theme so Icons may not show very well against others.  Colours can be changed by opening the relevant .svg file in a text editor and changing the fill, ie if something is white and you want it black change `fill:#ffffff` to `fill:#000000`.

As well as the usual `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` needing to be set to **`true`** in `about:config` or `user.js` `svg.context-properties.content.enabled` needs to be **`true`** as well.
